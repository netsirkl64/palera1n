# palera1n
iOS 15.0-15.4.1 checkm8 "jailbreak"

# What does this do?
Currently, it just boots the device with AMFI patches. In the future, I'd want this to install the Pogo app automatically when it's public.

# How to use
1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/itsnebulalol/palera1n && cd palera1n`
2. Prepare your blob for the current version you're on
3. Run `./palera1n.sh path/to/blob.shsh2`
4. Make sure your device is in normal mode
5. Follow the steps
    - Right now, getting into DFU is steps for A11, please suppliment the steps for your device
